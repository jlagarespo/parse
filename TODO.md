* Write a string wrapper type that implements `read` in the way you'd expect, and that's as
  unobtrusive as humanly possible.
* Parse function that returns a tuple of strings.
* More features that [parse](https://pypi.org/project/parse/) provides:
  - Searching a string for a pattern.
  - Parse function that allows for named fileds ("{field_name}") and returns a map in the form of
	FieldName -> Value. Of course that wouldn't play well with polymorphism.
* Test suite.
* Documentation.
